# MAX7325 Demo Board (I2C I/O Expander)

This project contains schematic and PCB for MAX7325 Demo Board. The idea behind
this project is to test MAX732x driver in Linux kernel (e.g. using BeagleBone
Black board). This is basically just a breakout board, no automation
capabilities or any fancy features added.

KiCad v5.0.1 was used for this project.
